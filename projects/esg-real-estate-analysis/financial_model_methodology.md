# Financial Model Methodology

## 1) Model Goal
Estimate whether ESG retrofit investments increase long-term asset value by combining:
- direct cost savings,
- revenue uplift,
- risk/occupancy improvements,
- and potential incentives.

## 2) Asset Profile (Representative)
- 220-unit multi-family property
- 285,000 rentable square feet
- Baseline annual gross potential rent: $8.72M
- Baseline occupancy: 93%

## 3) ESG Upgrade Package
| Category | Example Components | Initial CapEx (USD) |
|---|---|---:|
| Energy efficiency | LED retrofit, HVAC optimization, smart controls | 1,050,000 |
| Water efficiency | Low-flow fixtures, leak detection, irrigation controls | 360,000 |
| Envelope/comfort | Window film, insulation improvements | 410,000 |
| Certification & monitoring | ENERGY STAR/LEED support, metering software | 180,000 |
| **Total** |  | **2,000,000** |

## 4) Core Financial Logic

### A. Annual Utility Savings
- `Energy Savings = Baseline Energy Cost × Energy Reduction %`
- `Water Savings = Baseline Water Cost × Water Reduction %`
- Escalate savings annually based on utility inflation assumptions.

### B. Revenue Uplift
- `Effective Rent = Gross Potential Rent × Occupancy × (1 + ESG Rent Premium)`
- ESG improvements may increase occupancy and justify premium positioning.

### C. Incentives
- One-time grants/tax credit equivalents are netted against Year 0 or Year 1 investment burden.

### D. Operating Impact
- Net operating impact each year:

`NOI Impact = Utility Savings + Incremental Effective Rent - Incremental ESG Opex`

### E. Payback
- `Simple Payback (Years) = Initial Net Investment / Annual NOI Impact (Year 1)`

### F. Value Creation Lens
- `Implied Value Uplift = Stabilized NOI Impact / Exit Cap Rate`
- Used as directional value estimate for investment committee discussions.

## 5) Scenario Structure
Three scenarios capture uncertainty:
- **Downside**: lower savings realization, weaker rent premium, slower occupancy gain
- **Base**: expected market conditions and execution quality
- **Upside**: strong savings, stronger premium capture, favorable market momentum

## 6) Key Outputs Produced
- Five-year projection of rent, occupancy, utility savings, and NOI impact
- Scenario P&L totals and margin comparisons
- Benchmark positioning against peer projects

## 7) Suggested Excel Tabs
1. `Inputs_Assumptions`
2. `CapEx_Package`
3. `Benchmarking`
4. `5Y_Projection_Base`
5. `Scenario_Analysis`
6. `Charts_Client`

## 8) Decision Guidance
An ESG project is considered compelling when:
- payback is within mandate threshold,
- downside case preserves acceptable margin,
- and implied value uplift exceeds net investment with execution buffer.
