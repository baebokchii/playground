It includes complete, reusable content matching the original project scope:

1. **Financial modeling for ESG investment decisions**
2. **Benchmarking sustainable real estate projects**
3. **Five-year projections and scenario-based P&L analysis**
4. **Excel-ready visualization package for team/client presentations**

- `financial_model_methodology.md` — model logic, assumptions, and valuation approach
- `client_presentation_outline.md` — client-ready narrative and slide flow
- `data/assumptions.csv` — base assumptions used across all models
- `data/benchmark_projects.csv` — peer comparison dataset with payback and ESG metrics
