- How sensitive value creation is to energy prices, occupancy, and rent uplift?
- How does the target project compare to sustainable peers?
- What downside risks could delay value realization?

## Deliverables
- Assumption library and model framework
- Peer benchmark comparison table
- Five-year operating projection by scenario
- Scenario P&L table (Downside/Base/Upside)
